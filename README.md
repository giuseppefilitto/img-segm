# MRI colon-rectal cancer segmentation


Colon-rectal cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the large intestine resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of one of the cells making up the colon-rectal tract.  
In Western countries, colorectal cancer is the second largest malignant tumor after that of the breast in women and the third after that of the lung and prostate in men.
Therefore, radiomic analysis applied to radiological imaging is extremely useful in particular in identifying the regions of interest (ROI) through the application of dedicated radiomic algorithms / features. This process is also known as segmentation.  It can take place manually, semi-automatically and automatically.         
 The aim of this project is to perform automatic segmentation on Magnetic Resonance (MR) colon-rectal cancer images.
